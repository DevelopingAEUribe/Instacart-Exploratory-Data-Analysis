# Instacart Grocery Shopping Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to clean and analyze Instacart grocery shopping data to uncover insights into customer purchasing behavior. This includes identifying trends such as which products are most frequently purchased, how order frequency varies across days and hours, and which aisles are most popular. By the end of this project, we aim to produce visualizations and statistical summaries that help stakeholders better understand customer habits and improve strategic decision-making.

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is a modified version of Instacartâ€™s public dataset originally released for a Kaggle competition in 2017. It contains information about:
- Orders placed by users
- Products in each order
- Product metadata (like product names, aisles, and departments)
- Timing of orders (days of the week and hours of the day)

**Modifications to the dataset include:**
- A reduced dataset size for faster computation
- The introduction of missing values and duplicates
- Preservation of original distributions to maintain analytical validity

The main CSV files provided include:
- `orders.csv`: Order-level details including user ID, order number, and order timing
- `order_products.csv`: Information about which products are in each order
- `products.csv`, `aisles.csv`, `departments.csv`: Metadata about each product

##  Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, we aim to:
- Clean the data (handle duplicates and missing values)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key patterns such as:
  - The most commonly purchased products
  - Shopping patterns by day of week and hour of day
  - Customer reordering behavior
- Summarize insights that could inform business decisions or marketing strategies

All findings will be supported by well-labeled plots and concise explanations to ensure clarity and impact.
